## What is a Laser Maze?
A laser maze is a grid of squares, with a single solution. A square can be one of three different "states"
1. Player starting position: This contains starting coordinates, and initial beam direction
2. Empty: A beam will pass through an empty square in the same direction
3. Mirror: Changes beam direction. There are two Mirror options - "\" and "/"
